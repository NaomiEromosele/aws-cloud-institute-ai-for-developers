---

## Course Description
This course provides the skills to leverage AWS AI/ML technologies in real-world projects. It covers prompt engineering, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), building applications with Amazon Bedrock, and using frameworks like LangChain.

---

## Key Skills & Concepts Learned
- Differentiating between AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI.
- Effective prompt engineering techniques for large language models (LLMs).
- Using Amazon Bedrock to interact with foundation models from AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, and Amazon.
- Building serverless architectures that integrate Generative AI capabilities.
- Implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases to provide context-specific answers.
- Using the LangChain framework to build sophisticated, chained LLM workflows.
- Applying principles of Responsible AI, including fairness, explainability, and governance.
- Securing AI applications using tools like Amazon Bedrock Guardrails.

## Labs & Projects

### Lab: Practicing Prompt Engineering Methods
* **Description:** Explored different prompting techniques (e.g., zero-shot, few-shot) with a large language model using the Amazon Bedrock console.
* **Source Code:** `./lab-prompt-engineering`

### Lab: Performing RAG with Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock
* **Description:** Created an Amazon Bedrock knowledge base to accomplish Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) without coding, allowing an LLM to answer questions about proprietary information.
* **Source Code:** N/A (Console-based lab)

### Lab: Simplifying AI Development with LangChain
* **Description:** Used the LangChain framework to simplify the development of a generative AI application, demonstrating how to chain prompts and interact with Amazon Bedrock models.
* **Source Code:** `./lab-langchain`
